## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### What You Need
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Any modern browser
- (Optional) Arduino IDE if setting up hardware

### Step 1️⃣ - Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/decodermayank/LineSaathi.git
cd LineSaathi
```

### Step 2️⃣ - Install & Run
```bash
pip install flask
python app.py
```

### Step 3️⃣ - Open in Browser
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

✅ **Done!** You'll see the live dashboard.

---

## 🔐 Admin Access

1. Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin`
2. Enter password (set in `app.py`)
3. Control capacity, reset counters, manage the system

---

## 🔌 Hardware Setup (Optional)

Want to connect actual sensors? Here's how:

**What You'll Connect:**
- **Entry Sensor** → Counts people coming in
- **Exit Sensor** → Counts people going out  
- **Arduino** → Talks to your server

**How It Works:**
```
Person enters → Sensor 1 triggers → Arduino counts → Server updates → Dashboard shows!
```

**To Upload Code:**
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Load `Arduino_Code.txt`
3. Connect Arduino via USB
4. Click Upload

That's it! Sensors will start feeding data.
